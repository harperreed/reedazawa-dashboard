# reedazawa-dashboard

A simple dashboard for my house

## History

* ~2010ish generated images for display on hacked kindle
* ~2013 used dashing (from shopify) to handle various widgets
* ~2016 used node to display a bunch of custom widgets
* went back to dashing (now called smashing) to better handle multiple dashboard

It works relatively well. 

## About

I am hosting it using docker. The docker-compose.yml is to make things a bit easier. I push some env variables in via the yaml file for API keys and what not. 

## future

I hope time travel is invented
